# PRIVACY-PRESERVING-FEDERATED-REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-FOR-ANOMALY-RESPONSE
This project implements a privacy-preserving, federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) system for real-time network anomaly detection and response. Using the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset, the system simulates multiple distributed network sites that collaboratively train a shared model without sharing raw data.
